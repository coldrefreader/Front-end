# Front-end
Hello everyone, this is the front-end of Quizaroth and also contains the chat server. 
Once you're in the project, open 2 terminals - one for the server chat and the other for the main project. ( at least for me it did not allow me to have 1 terminal for both )

For the server, commands are:
1. cd websocket-server
2. node server.js

For the main project, simply type:
1. npm run dev

Of course, make sure to also start the back-end in order for the Multiplayer and Question functionality to work.
